  h2 how to draw
  #text
    p Frames use vector format (SVG), you need to take the coordinates of the shape from the file they are located at (digital sequence of text)
    p All parts of the "avatar" are divided into frames, on average they are 3, 5, 7 horizontal frames (there are no vertical ones)
    p In order for animation to work properly, it is necessary for points to be in right order, with the same quantity in frames, it is easy to observe if copied from the previous frame, afterwards providing changes for new one
